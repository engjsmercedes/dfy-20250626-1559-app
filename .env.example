# API Key Management Instructions
# 
# IMPORTANT: Your premium build includes a secure API key management system.
# Here's how it works:
#
# ✅ WHAT'S INCLUDED:
#   - User-specific API key storage (encrypted in database)
#   - Secure key management through Settings page
#   - Each user manages their own API keys and billing
#   - No shared rate limits or usage concerns
#
# ✅ HOW TO USE:
#   1. Users sign up/login to your app
#   2. They go to Settings → API Keys
#   3. They add their own OpenAI, Stripe, Resend keys
#   4. Keys are encrypted and stored securely per user
#   5. Each user pays their API providers directly
#
# ✅ BENEFITS:
#   - Better security (per-user encrypted keys)
#   - User ownership (each user pays for their usage)
#   - Scalability (no shared limits)
#   - Compliance (proper key management)
#
